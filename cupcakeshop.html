   <p class="flashy">The Cupcake Station was the first cupcake shop in Michigan and one of the very first in the country. We have been baking gourmet     cupcakes,100% from Scratch, since day one. We always use the finest and most
   natural ingredients we can find. We had a hard time deciding which
   cupcakes to bake each day that we decided to bake 24 flavors everyday
    so our customers can have a variety of flavors to choose from.
    The Cupcake Station was also the first to create the Bump-a-licious
    Cupcake and it has become one of our best sellers and has even made
    the national news. You can't go wrong with a cupcakes dipped in Chocolate!
    Since we opened our first location in 2006, our cupcakes have been
    enjoyed by thousands including Martha Stewart, Bobby Flay and Michigan's
    former Governor Jennifer Granholm. And now with the launch of our
    new eCommerce website, we're very excited to be shipping
    cupcakes, so that many more canenjoy our cupcakes
    all over the country! .</p>
